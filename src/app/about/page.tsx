      <p className="mb-4">At Wellgrove Care Group, we believe true care should never be prescriptive. Our Multi-Disciplinary Team creates bespoke packages of support that adapt to individual needs, rather than expecting individuals to adapt to predefined services. This dynamic, person-centred approach allows us to stick with those we support through times of challenge, change, and progress.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We’re specialists in complex and high-needs care, with continued investment in expert-led support teams—most notably our Positive Behaviour Management Team—whose work reduces placement breakdowns, strengthens staff capability, and helps individuals experience genuine stability and growth.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Our Positive Behaviour Management Team is made up of highly experienced social care and health professionals trained in Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) and Positive Behaviour Management (PBM). They complete functional assessments and recommend effective strategies to reduce behaviours that challenge and to promote greater quality of life. This includes staff mentoring and training in topics like Autism Spectrum Conditions, Self-Injurious Behaviour, Intensive Interaction, and Motivation Assessment Scales. They also support new referrals through collaborative transition planning and help develop meaningful, ongoing support programmes.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">All of this is underpinned by Wellgrove’s commitment to Person-Centred Thinking and Planning, ensuring that the support we provide reflects the culture of dignity, choice, and ambition.</p>
